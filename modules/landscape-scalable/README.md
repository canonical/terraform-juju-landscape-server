# Landscape Server Scalable Product Module

This module requires a bootstrapped Juju cloud with a model created within it, the name of which can be provided as `model`.

For example, bootstrap a LXD cloud:

```sh
juju bootstrap lxd landscape-controller
```

Then, create a model named `landscape`:

```sh
juju add-model landscape
```

Then, use `landscape` as the value for `model`.

After deploying the module to the model, use the `juju status` command to monitor the lifecycle:

```sh
juju status -m landscape --relations --watch 2s
```

> [!TIP]
> Customize the module inputs with a `terraform.tfvars` file. An example is `terraform.tfvars.example`, which can be used after removing the `.example` extension.
